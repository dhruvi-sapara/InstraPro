Created REST API endpoints for user registration, login, profile update,
and password recovery via email. Implemented JWT authentication for secure
login and email functionality for password recovery. Additionally, integrated
Bootstrap for the admin panel UI, allowing administrators to view the list
of users in a tabular format.
